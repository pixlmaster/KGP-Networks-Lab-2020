After compiling client file and executing it-
1. entering file name in the server directory(with extension) will copy its contents into "result.txt" in the client folder.
(entering word command is handled by the client in background, no need to explixitly write in terminal)
2. "exit" will exit both client and server
3. Entering a file which does not exist will result in termination of client after proper message(server keeps running , waiting for another connection).
